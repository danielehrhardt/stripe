     * Stripe uses `setup_future_usage` to dynamically optimize your payment flow and comply with regional legislation and network rules. For example, if your customer is impacted by [SCA](https://stripe.com/docs/strong-customer-authentication), using `off_session` will ensure that they are authenticated while processing this PaymentIntent. You will then be able to collect [off-session payments](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/cards/charging-saved-cards#off-session-payments-with-saved-cards) for this customer.

     * If `setup_future_usage` is already set and you are performing a request using a publishable key, you may only update the value from `on_session` to `off_session`.
